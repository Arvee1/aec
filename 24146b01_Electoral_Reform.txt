received the gift; and  22 
 (b) if the group is a jointly endorsed group or none of the group ’s 23 
members is a candidate endorsed by a registered political 24 
party —each member of the group is taken to have received 25 
an equal share of the g ift (rounded to the nearest dollar); and  26 
 (c) in any case —the group is taken not to have received the gift.  27 
Note:  Candidates may be subject to expedited disclosure requirements in 28 
relation to their share of the gift (see section  303A). Gifts received by 29 
endorsed candidates of a registered political party may be aggregated 30 
in certain circumstances for the purpose of determining whether a gift 31 
exceeds the relevant gift cap (see section  302BA ). 32

  (2) For the purposes of subsection  (1), the amount that is targeted to 1 
the Division, State or Territory is:  2 
 (a) unless paragraph  (b) appl ies—the amount of the expenditure; 3 
or 4 
 (b) if the electoral matter to which the expenditure relates is 5 
express coverage matter for more than one Division, State or 6 
Territory —that share of the expenditure that the liable person 7 
or financial controller for t he person or  entity  is reasonably  8 
satisfied  reflects the distribution of the electoral matter in the 9 
Division, State or Territory.  10 
 (3) Electoral matter is express coverage matter  for a Division, State or 11 
Territory if the electoral matter:  12 
 (a) is communic ated to electors enrolled in the Division, State or 13 
Territory; and  14

 (ii) expressly mentions the Division or a Senate election for 20 
the State or Territory.  21 
 (4) Despite subsection  (1), an amount of electoral expenditure is not 22 
targeted to any Division, State or Territory if:  23 
 (a) the electoral matter to which the expenditure relates is a 24 
how-to-vote card; and  25 
 (b) if the electoral matter contains matter additional to matter 26 
that satisfies paragraph  (a), (b) or (c) of the definition of 27 
how-to-vote card —the dominant purpose of the matter is to 28 
convey matter that satisfies paragraph  (a), (b) or (c) of the 29

  Electora l expenditure incurred by a person or entity is expenditure 3 
covered by the by -election or Senate -only election caps  if the 4 
expenditure is incurred by the person or entity:  5 
 (a) in the by -election period for a by -election and for the 6 
purposes of the by -election; or  7 
 (b) in the Senate -only election period for a Senate -only election 8 
and for the purposes of the Senate -only election.  9 
Note:  Expenditure covered by the by -election or Senate -only election caps 10 
does not count towards the calendar year expenditure caps (see 11

302ALE   Acceptable expenditure action  13 
Definition of acceptable expenditure action  14 
 (1) Acceptable expenditure action  is taken in relation to an amount of 15 
electoral expenditure if:  16 
 (a) the expenditure of the amount is cancelled or reversed; or  17 
 (b) the recipient of the amount repays an equivalent amount to 18 
the person or entity that incurred the particular expenditure; 19 
or 20 
 (c) in relation to a cap mentioned in Subdivision C —the member 21 
of the expenditure group that incurred the expenditure, or 22 
another member of that group, transfers an equivalent 23 
amount to the Commonwealth for the purposes of this 24 
Division; or  25 
 (d) in relation to a cap mentioned in Subdivision D,  E or F —the 26 
person or entity that incurred the expenditure transfers an 27 
equivalent amount to the Commonwealth for the purposes of 28 
this Division.  29 
Effect of acceptable expenditure action on total expenditure  30 
 (2) Nothing in this Division prevents the taking of acceptable 31 
expenditure action in relation to an amount that is not an excess 32 
amount (within the meaning of a civil penalty provision in 33 
Subdivision C, D, E or F).  34 Expenditure caps   Schedule 4

  (3) However, for the purposes of such a civil penalty provision, the 1 
taking of acceptable  expenditure action in relation to an amount, 2 
after a time at which the total electoral expenditure concerned has 3 
exceeded the cap concerned, does not reduce the total amount of 4 
expenditure incurred.  5 
Note:  This means that once a cap is exceeded, there is n o way to 6 
subsequently reduce total expenditure to an amount that is below the 7 
cap (even if, by taking acceptable expenditure action, a penalty is 8 
avoided).  9 
302ALF   Expenditure group  10 
Definition of expenditure group  11 
 (1) Each registered political party (a group owner ) that is not itself a 12 
State branch of another registered political party or related to 13 
another registered political party in the way described in 14 
paragraph  (b), has an expenditure group  that is made up of:  15 
 (a) the following core members : 16 
 (i) the group owner;  17 
 (ii) any State branch of the group owner;  18 
 (iii) any candidate endorsed by a registered political party 19 
covered by subparagraph  (i) or (ii);  20 
 (iv) any member of the House of Representatives or Senator 21 
who is a member of a registered political party covered 22 
by subparagraph  (i) or (ii);  23 
 (v) any nominated entity of a registered political party 24 
covered by subparagraph  (i) or (ii); and  25 
 (b) any registere d political party that, while not being a State 26 
branch of the group owner, is  related to the group owner 27 
within the meaning of paragraph  123(2)(a) because it is part 28 
of the group owner; and  29 
 (c) any candidate endorsed by a registered political party 30 
covere d by paragraph  (b) of this subsection ; and  31 
 (d) any member of the House of Representatives or Senator who 32 
is a member of a registered political party covered by 33 
paragraph  (b) of this subsection ; and  34 
 (e) any nominated entity of a registered political party  covered 35

members of a registered political party ’s expenditure group for the 2 
purposes of this Division.  3

Expenditure of member of multiple expenditure groups counts 7 
towards expenditure caps for each group  8 
 (2) If a person or entity is a member of more than one registered 9 
political party ’s expenditure group, then, for the purposes of 10 
Subdivision C, electoral expenditure incurred by the person or 11 
entity counts towards the total electoral expenditure of each such 12 
expenditure g roup.  13 
Example:  The Federal Quokka Party, the Quokka Party (WA), the Federal 14 
Wombat Party and the Wombat -Quokka Party (SA) are all registered 15 
political parties. The Quokka Party (WA) is a State branch of the 16 
Federal Quokka Party. The Wombat -Quokka Party (SA ) is a State 17 
branch of the Federal Wombat Party. The Wombat -Quokka Party 18 
(SA) is not a State branch of the Federal Quokka Party but it is related 19 
to the Federal Quokka Party  within the meaning of 20 
paragraph  123(2)(a)  because it is  a part of the Federal Quok ka Party.  21 
 The Quokka Party (WA) is a member of the Federal Quokka Party ’s 22 
expenditure group.  23 
 The Wombat -Quokka Party (SA) is a member of the Federal Wombat 24 
Party ’s expenditure group. It is also a member of the Federal Quokka 25 
Party ’s expenditure group  under paragraph  (1)(b).  26 
 The Wombat -Quokka Party (SA) incurs $50,000 of electoral 27 
expenditure. This expenditure will count towards the Federal cap for 28 
both of the expenditure groups that the Wombat -Quokka Party (SA) is 29 
a member of. If the expenditure is targe ted to a Division, State or 30 
Territory within the meaning of section  302ALC, it will also count 31 
towards the Divisional cap or Senate cap for both of the expenditure 32 
groups.  33

of the particular expenditure; or  15 
 (b) if, immediately before the particular expenditure was 16 
incurred, total electoral expenditure incurred as mentioned in 17 
paragraph  (1)(c) was less than the Federal cap —so much of 18 
the particular expenditure as results in total expenditure 19 
exceeding  that cap.  20 
 (3) To avoid doubt, electoral expenditure targeted to a Division, State 21 
or Territory is also electoral expenditure that counts towards the 22 
Federal cap.  23 
Note:  However, expenditure covered by the by -election or Senate -only 24

Federal Quokka Party. Candidate K. Roo is the Quokka Party (ACT) ’s 17 
endorsed candidate for the Division of Canberra. The Quokka Party 18 
(ACT) and K. Roo , along with the Federal Quokka Party itself,  are 19 
therefore all members of the Federal Quokka Party ’s expenditure 20 
group  (see the definition of expenditure group  in section  302ALF ). 21 
The Quokka Party (ACT) and K. Roo each spend $10,000 on 22 
advertisements  promoting K. Roo as the Quokka Party candidate for 23 
Canberra for the upcoming federa l election. That electoral expenditure 24 
of $20,000 will count towards the Divisional cap, as well as the 25 
Federal cap, for the Federal Quokka Party ’s expenditure group  as it 26 
was incurred by members of the expenditure group . 27 
 (2) For the purposes of this sect ion, the excess amount of the particular 28
